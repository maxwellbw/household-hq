# Household HQ — Backlog / Sprint Tracker

Source of truth for feature order: `docs/household-hq-project-brief.md` §10.
Per-feature detail lives in `specs/NNN-name/`. This file is the one-glance index —
update it whenever a feature moves stage (spec written, plan done, tasks generated,
implemented, merged). Ask Claude to "update BACKLOG.md" after any speckit step or PR merge.

**Stage legend:** `spec` → `clarify` → `plan` → `tasks` → `implement` → `deployed` → `merged`

## Phase 1 — Core (MVP)

## Currently active

**006 — Calendar UI (home screen)** (next in brief §10). Not started.
Kick off with "start feature 006" to run the full Phase 7 loop.

_005 merged in [#5](https://github.com/maxwellbw/household-hq/pull/5); backend deployed at `clasp` @10 (event-driven prep-template generation, nightly `generatePrepTasks` trigger installed alongside 004's `generateRecurringTasks`)._

## How to keep this current

- After `/speckit.specify`: mark stage `spec written`.
- After `/speckit.clarify`: mark stage `clarified`.
- After `/speckit.plan`: mark stage `planned`.
- After `/speckit.tasks`: mark stage `tasks generated` (⏸ review gate — waiting on go-ahead).
- After `/speckit.implement` + clasp deploy + quickstart validation: mark stage `implemented, pending PR`.
- After PR merge: mark stage `✅ merged`, fill in the PR link, move "Currently active" to the next feature in brief §10.
